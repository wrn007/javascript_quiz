# javascript_quiz
A javascript based quiz creation assignment
The goal of this assignment was to create a multiple choice quiz using javascript.
This includes creating both the HTML and css assets from scratch. This timed quiz should include a scorepage where users can see their scores compared to their friends, and a time deduction after getting a question wrong. 

 I unfortunately could not complete this assignment. I got as far as i could and put as many comments as i could to show my understanding, but since my code fails someplace early, it is near impossible to debug or test my preceding code
 There is no point in not submitting anything, so i have done my best with what i have accomplished
